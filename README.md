Hello Everyone!

I'm Bardia Gharachorlou and I am writing this letter about my self to those who are wondering about me. I am in grade 11 and I go to St. Robert Catholic High School. I am 16 years of age and I am writing this for a course I am taking which is Computer Science. I wish to learn a lot in this course and use it in my future. I like pizza and video games and I also like sports.
